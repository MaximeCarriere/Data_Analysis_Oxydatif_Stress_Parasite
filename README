# Data Analysis of Oxydatif Stress due to Parasite


The goal of this study is to analyse the impact of the parasite Acanthocephales in the stress oxydatif and other parameters.


Parameters:
    - Region
    - Presence or absence of Parasite
    - Size
    - Weight
    - Liver Weight
    - Ratio of phtalate
    - Ratio of ROM (indicator of oxydatif stress in blood)
    - Ratio of OXY (other indicator of oxydatif stress in blood)
